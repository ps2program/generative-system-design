To test the above implementation using **Postman**, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Start the Flask Server**
Make sure your Flask application is running:
```bash
python app.py
```
The Flask app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default.

---

### **2. Configure Postman**
1. **Open Postman**.
2. **Create a new request**:
   - Method: **POST**
   - URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/process-requirements`

---

### **3. Set the Headers**
Add the following header in Postman:
- **Key**: `Content-Type`
- **Value**: `application/json`

---

### **4. Prepare the Request Body**
In the request body, send a JSON object with the list of requirements. For example:
```json
{
  "requirements": [
    {
      "name": "Power Source 120v",
      "description": "Battery or other power source of 120V"
    },
    {
      "name": "Motor",
      "description": "Stepper motor design"
    },
    {
      "name": "Control System",
      "description": "Embedded system with sensors"
    }
  ]
}
```

1. Go to the **Body** tab in Postman.
2. Select **raw** and paste the above JSON.

---

### **5. Send the Request**
1. Click the **Send** button.
2. Postman will start receiving **incremental responses** as server-sent events (SSE).

---

### **6. View the Incremental Responses**
Since SSE sends data in chunks, you'll see responses like this in the Postman console/logs:
```
data: {"requirement": "Power Source 120v", "physical_name": "Physical for Power Source 120v", "description": "Battery design"}
data: {"requirement": "Motor", "physical_name": "Physical for Motor", "description": "Stepper motor design"}
data: {"requirement": "Control System", "physical_name": "Physical for Control System", "description": "Sensor-based embedded system"}
```

However, **Postman does not natively display SSE responses**. To debug or test SSE fully, use one of the following options:

---

### **Alternative SSE Test Tools**
1. **curl**:
   Run this command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   curl -N -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"requirements":[{"name":"Power Source 120v","description":"Battery or other power source of 120V"},{"name":"Motor","description":"Stepper motor design"},{"name":"Control System","description":"Embedded system with sensors"}]}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/process-requirements
   ```

2. **EventSource Polyfill Testing**:
   Create a small JavaScript app to handle SSE directly in the browser:
   ```javascript
   const eventSource = new EventSource("http://127.0.0.1:5000/process-requirements");

   eventSource.onmessage = function(event) {
       console.log("Received:", event.data);
   };
   ```

3. **Postman Workaround**:
   - Use the **console** logs in Postman or export the logs for debugging.
